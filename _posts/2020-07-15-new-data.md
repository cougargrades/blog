Spring 2020 data was received from the University of Houston and will start uploading to the database at 2:00 AM on July 16, 2020 (Houston time). Some downtime may be experienced during that period. Expect Spring 2020 data to populate during the day of July 16, 2020.

[Source data](https://github.com/cougargrades/publicdata/blob/7849a0f001bb73a2c63ef98dd6ac79fdcb1df82d/documents/edu.uh.grade_distribution/Interim%20Grade%20Policy/IR06573%20Responsive%20Information.csv)

## Interim Undergraduate Grade Policy

Some of you may be curious about the effects of the [Interim Undergraduate Grade Policy](https://uh.edu/provost/policies-resources/student/interim-undergraduate-grade-policy/index) that was in place during the Spring 2020 semester. This policy was put in place in response to the sudden transition to online learning in response to the COVID-19 global health crisis. Below are 3 visual aids that present the number of grades issued for the Spring 2020, Fall 2019, and Spring 2019 semesters.

Before making any conclusions from this visual aid, I recommend you analyze the source data yourself below.

Note: 
- "S" means "Satisfactory", as described [here](https://uh.edu/provost/policies-resources/student/interim-undergraduate-grade-policy/index).
- "W" means "Drop with W", as described [here](https://uh.edu/provost/policies-resources/student/).
