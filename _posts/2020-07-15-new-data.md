Spring 2020 data was received from the University of Houston and will start uploading to the database at 2:00 AM on July 16, 2020 (Houston time). Some downtime may be experienced during that period. Expect Spring 2020 data to populate during the day of July 16, 2020.

[Source data](https://github.com/cougargrades/publicdata/blob/7849a0f001bb73a2c63ef98dd6ac79fdcb1df82d/documents/edu.uh.grade_distribution/Interim%20Grade%20Policy/IR06573%20Responsive%20Information.csv)

## Interim Undergraduate Grade Policy

Some of you may be curious about the effects of the [Interim Undergraduate Grade Policy](https://uh.edu/provost/policies-resources/student/interim-undergraduate-grade-policy/index) that was in place during the Spring 2020 semester. This policy was put in place in response to the sudden transition to online learning as a result of the COVID-19 global health crisis. Below are 3 visual aids that present the number of grades issued for the Spring 2020, Fall 2019, and Spring 2019 semesters.

Before making any conclusions from this visual aid, I recommend you analyze the source data yourself below.

Note:
- "S" means "Satisfactory", as described [here](https://uh.edu/provost/policies-resources/student/interim-undergraduate-grade-policy/index).
- "W" means "Drop with W", as described [here](https://uh.edu/provost/policies-resources/student/).

### Edit, July 20, 2020:

If you're curious about where "NCR" grades factored into this, I cannot provide any answers. In my formal public data request to the University of Houston, I requested that "NCR" grades be included, but they were specifically excluded in [their response](https://github.com/cougargrades/publicdata/blob/7849a0f001bb73a2c63ef98dd6ac79fdcb1df82d/documents/edu.uh.grade_distribution/Interim%20Grade%20Policy/IR06573%20Responsive%20Information.csv).

_My phrasing:_

> Please note, I have included the "S" and "NCR" fields as part of the Spring 2020 Interim Grade Policy. If including these fields is extra work or otherwise incompatible with your procedures, please do not include them as part of this request.

This phrasing is specific because if I ask for data that they cannot/won't produce due to any reason, it could invalidate my entire request.
