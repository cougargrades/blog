Summer 2020 data was received from the University of Houston and will start uploading to the database at 5:00PM on December 29, 2020 (Houston time). Some downtime may be experienced during that period. Expect Summer 2020 data to populate overnight.

[Source data](https://github.com/cougargrades/publicdata/blob/1214628c0eae728f8dd5c2b304db6d2787bf2be8/documents/edu.uh.grade_distribution/Interim%20Grade%20Policy/IR06861%20Summer%202020%20Grade%20distribution.csv)

## Interim Undergraduate Grade Policy

In my last update, I added Spring 2020 grades to the database. In that update, UH did not provide me with any data on the "NCR" count, but did provide data for the "S" count. However, UH *did* provide "NCR" data for Summer 2020. That can be seen in the source data but won't be visible on the CougarGrades.io website until a future update is made.
