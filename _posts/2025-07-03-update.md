This announcement will cover a couple different areas.

## ðŸ”§ 1.1.3 Update

Changes in this update:

- **SimpleSyllabus Integration:**
  - {% include sfsymbol.html src="addition.svg" %} Added the "X Syllabi Found" button on the Course page
  - This button will show if any syllabi were found to be *currently available* on [the official UH Syllabus website](https://uh.simplesyllabus.com/).
  - This feature was [requested by @uhislam](https://github.com/cougargrades/web/issues/154). Thanks for the great idea!
  - **Disclaimer:**
    - _Past versions of syllabi are **not stored by CougarGrades**._
    - _The availability of syllabi through SimpleSyllabus is subject to their [data retention policy](https://uh.edu/policies/other-uh-policy-resources/syllabi-and-cvs/faqs/#wheretofindsyllabus)._
    - _Syllabi made available by UH prior to the instruction of SimpleSyllabus through their PeopleSoft system, Blackboard, or Canvas are **not accessible** by this feature._
    - _Due to the nature of this feature, it may break at any time if SimpleSyllabus decides to change how their website API works or blocks CougarGrades servers from accessing their service._

## ðŸ“Š Data Refresh

- {% include sfsymbol.html src="addition.svg" %} Grade Distribution data from **Summer 2022 to Fall 2024** has been added thanks to [the volunteer work done by @adamnelsonarcher](https://github.com/cougargrades/publicdata/pull/47)

- {% include sfsymbol.html src="change.svg" %} Core Curriculum data has been updated from the 2024-2025 Undergraduate Catalog
- {% include sfsymbol.html src="change.svg" %} Course Descriptions have been updated from the 2024-2025 Catalog
- {% include sfsymbol.html src="change.svg" %} Data about the individual colleges at UH has been updated
  - Ex: College of Education, Hobby School of Public Affairs, etc
- {% include sfsymbol.html src="change.svg" %} Subject data have been updated from the 2024-2025 Catalog
  - Ex: "POPH" â†’ "Population Health", "SGNL" â†’ "American Sign Language", etc

## ðŸ”­ New Policy: Future Data Refreshes will be driven by volunteers

Previously, the acquisition of all data was done by me. Since I graduated from UH 4 years ago now in 2021 <sub><small>(wow, time flies)</small></sub>, I don't have the time to see this process through anymore.

[After receiving assistance from @adamnelsonarcher](https://github.com/cougargrades/publicdata/pull/47) in adding long-awaited data from Summer 2022 to Fall 2024, I've been persuaded to stop trying to run a one-man-show anymore.

**All future refreshes to grade distribution data on CougarGrades will need to be performed by volunteers.**

As of Update 1.1.3, this process and instructions are [documented in our FAQ](https://cougargrades.io/faq/data-updates). If you contact me about any missing data in the future, I will refer you to this page.
