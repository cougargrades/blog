This update changes a couple of small things about the site.
- ### Fall 2021 (and all future) TCCNS Updates

  <img style="width:100%;max-width:600px;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2022-01-02.png">

  As part of [the Fall 2021 TCCNS Updates](https://web.archive.org/web/20210415084338/https://uh.edu/academics/courses-enrollment/course-number-updates/index.php), many courses had their course numbers changed.
  
  CougarGrades is addressing this by displaying a link to **both** the **previous and current** course numbers. This means that MATH 1310 will link to MATH 1314, and MATH 1314 will link to MATH 1310. Historical grade data made under a previous course number will remain the same, which means that these new course numbers will appear to have no history if visited directly, but will have their history accessible via their old course number.

  **This is not currently visible on the site and will take effect when Fall 2021 data is added in the coming weeks.**

- removed the line chart on the Groups page due to the implementation being cost inefficient
- fixed the search bar looking weird on iOS
- updated the libraries used within the site
