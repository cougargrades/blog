The 1.0.0 update is finally here. CougarGrades has been redesigned and rebuilt from the ground up. In this update, CougarGrades is leaving beta and getting *many* new features.

With the new update, recreating the database is required, so there will be a couple hours of downtime. In this downtime, Spring 2021 data will be added.

We hope that you'll like the new update. Thanks for using CougarGrades.
