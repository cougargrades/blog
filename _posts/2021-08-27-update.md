This update fixes some issues with the site:

- *"Loading X sections..."* component now shows an interactive progress bar instead of a circle spinner
- Implemented caching, section loading performance improved dramatically
- Section DataTable now sort in descending order by default. The most recent sections will now be at the top by default instead of the bottom.
- Fixed some styling issues in the header row of a DataTable. Header row titles shouldn't be cut off on mobile anymore.
