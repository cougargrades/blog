title: "ðŸŽ‰ 0.4.0 Update: Instructor search is now available"
---

At long last, the Instructor search is here.

Interested in taking a course but none of the instructors that are offerred have a history of teaching that course before? Well, now you can learn more about their background within the university and see how they've done in other courses.

This feature has been in the works for a long time, and I'm proud with how it's come along. In past blog posts, I've talked briefly about some of the behind-the-scenes work made along the way, such as with the database upgrades necessary to make the front-end possible.

    span.gr {
        color: #515151;
        border-radius: 0.3rem;
        padding: 0.1rem;
    }
</style>

Pictured below is an example of an Instructor search result. The labels above the professor's name is both the GPA and the [standard deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation) respectively for the professor in question. The colors of the labels, inspired by [AggieScheduler](https://aggiescheduler.com/), are indicative of the score. An <span class="gr" style='background:lightskyblue;'>A average</span> is blue, a <span class="gr" style='background:lightgreen;'>B average</span> is green, a <span class="gr" style='background:yellow;'>C average</span> is yellow, and a <span class="gr" style='background:lightsalmon;'>D average</span> is orange.

### Preventing arbitrary thresholds in the color indication

To prevent the standard deviation thresholds from being biased or misleading, I created a frequency distribution and decided to use the [probability mass function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_mass_function) to estimate when the cut-off should be. The results were pretty informative.

**For the standard deviation values of all instructors (latest data: Summer 2019)**
- min: `0.0007071067811864697`
- mean: `0.28632900784232573`
- median: `0.24911322128640845`
- max: `1.6836212460051696`
- 25% likely to have stddev under 0.149
- 50% likely to have stddev under 0.286
- 75% likely to have stddev under 0.425
