This update adds a new feature to the site:
- ### RateMyProfessors integration

  <img width="328" height="94" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2021-09-05.png">

  On Instructor pages, a link to their corresponding RateMyProfessors.com page is provided. About 50% of all instructors on CougarGrades have a link. For the others, a match could not be confidently found by our [automated tools](https://github.com/cougargrades/publicdata/tree/e593014975b08d9cc603d3bb966e2b37344ef1ef/documents/com.ratemyprofessors).

  *Note: It is not guaranteed that the instructors linked are 100% accurate, so please use your own judgement.*
