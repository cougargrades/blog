Some of you may have noticed that CougarGrades is missing data from Fall 2022 and Spring 2023.

As mentioned in [our FAQ](https://cougargrades.io/faq/data-updates), requests for new data are sent to UH automatically about a month or so after the conclusion of every semester.

On January 28, 2023, one of these requests was sent to UH for Fall 2022 data. I did not ever receive a response. This was unusual, and I won't speculate why. On February 21, 2023, I sent a follow-up email asking if there were any updates to my request, or if any action on my part was required in order to have it fulfilled. I still never received a response.

On May 30, 2023, the next request was sent to UH for Spring 2023 data. I received a response 13 days later asking for clarifications with my request. I don't think that has ever happened before, so I found that unusual. I provided my clarifications a few days later in a follow-up email and I'm still waiting to hear back.

I'm not sure why my dialog with UH has changed in small ways within the past 2 semesters, but I am grateful that they responded to my most recent request.

<abbr title="too long; didn't read"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TL;DR">TL;DR</a></abbr>, these are the reasons that Fall 2022 and Spring 2023 data is missing. Hopefully it will be added soon, and future data updates will process more smoothly.

Thank you for using CougarGrades.
