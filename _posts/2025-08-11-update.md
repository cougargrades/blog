Changes in this update:

- **ðŸ“ˆ New Charts: Popular Page**
  - {% include sfsymbol.html src="addition.svg" %} The "Popular" page will now display sparkline graphs that convey the enrollment history of the course over time
  - The Y-Axis of all graphs are scaled to be the same within their own category (courses vs instructors), so they're safe to compare against each other.
  - Hovering over the graph will give you a tooltip showing the enrollment for that course/instructor during that specific semester
  - <small>I think they look super pretty ðŸ¤©</small>

- **ðŸ“ˆ New Charts: Course &amp; Instructor Page**
  - {% include sfsymbol.html src="addition.svg" %} Both the "Course" and "Instructor" page will now have a **"Seasonal Availability"** pie chart which gives an at-a-glance look at whether a particular Course or Instructor is more available during one season vs another.
  - <small>I really love the colors for each season ðŸ¤©</small>

  - {% include sfsymbol.html src="addition.svg" %} Both the "Course" and "Instructor" page will now have an **"Enrollment Data"** bar chart which shows enrollment data over time, grouped by semester and calendar year
  - Hovering over the graph will give you a tooltip showing the enrollment for that course/instructor during that specific semester or calendar year
  - There are 2 options for scaling the Y-Axis:
    - **"Consistent"** = The Y-Axis range is based on <u>data from across the site</u>.
      - This works just like the sparklines, where the Y-Axis of all graphs are scaled to be the same within their own category (courses vs instructors), so they're safe to compare against each other.
    - **"Automatic"** = The Y-Axis range is based on <u>only data in the individual chart</u>
