CougarGrades is getting its first major update since the big redesign in 1.0.0 with some hand-crafted new features.

Changes in this update:

- **"Popular" page:**
  - {% include sfsymbol.html src="addition.svg" %} Added the "ðŸ”¥ Popular" page
  - This page has 4 different tabs under it:
    - _Top Enrolled Courses_
    - _Most Viewed Courses_ -- Powered by Google Analytics
    - _Top Enrolled Instructors_
    - _Most Viewed Instructors_ -- Powered by Google Analytics

- **Bug Fixed: GPA/SD calculation fixed**
  - {% include sfsymbol.html src="checkmark.svg" %} Fixed bug where GPA/SD was calculated incorrectly, resulting in some Courses/Instructors having very poorly skewed data ([#115](https://github.com/cougargrades/web/issues/115))
  - This is a bug that has been affecting CougarGrades for some time, often leading to misleading results. It disproportionately affected Graduate level Courses/Instructors and we're happy to have it resolved.
  - Below is a Before/After example using the Course [PCOL 6198](https://cougargrades.io/c/PCOL%206198) and its associated Instructors

- **"Random" button:**
  - {% include sfsymbol.html src="addition.svg" %} Added the "ðŸ”€ Random" button
  - Clicking the "Random" button will take you to a random Course or Instructor
  - The <kbd>/random</kbd>, <kbd>/random/course</kbd>, and <kbd>/random/instructor</kbd> links are all valid

- **Improved Search Engine**
  - {% include sfsymbol.html src="addition.svg" %} Added a new Search Engine to replace the old one.
  - This new search engine is fast, is tolerant to typos, and is processed entirely in the browser.
  - Uses search algorithm [Okapi BM25](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25), which has been used since the 1970s, powered by open-source project [Lyra](https://github.com/LyraSearch/lyra).
  - Searches against a Course's name, short description, and long description

    - From College of Architecture, to College of Technology, and more.
  - {% include sfsymbol.html src="addition.svg" %} Added "All Subjects" Group

  - {% include sfsymbol.html src="change.svg" %} Other various small UI/UX changes

- **Bug fixes:**

  - {% include sfsymbol.html src="checkmark.svg" %} Improved various 404 pages

- **Technical changes:**
  - {% include sfsymbol.html src="change.svg" %} The web app should be much faster. It fetches data in a much smarter way.
    - We no longer use the Firestore Web SDK in our front-end and instead use HTTP requests to our serverless API powered by [Vercel](https://vercel.com/?utm_source=cougargrades&utm_campaign=oss)
