This announcement will cover a couple different areas.

## ðŸ”§ 1.1.4 Update

Changes in this update:

- **RateMyProfessors Integration:**
  - {% include sfsymbol.html src="addition.svg" %} Added the ability to search RateMyProfessors on the Instructor page
  - This integration will show live data from the RateMyProfessors service.
  - This replaces a previous integration where professors were [searched ahead of time and embedded into the database](https://github.com/cougargrades/publicdata/tree/master/documents/com.ratemyprofessors).
  - **Disclaimer:**
    - _Similar to the SimpleSyllabus integration added in 1.1.3, this feature may break at any time if RMP decides to change how their website API works or blocks CougarGrades servers from accessing their service._
