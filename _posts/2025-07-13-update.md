Changes in this update:

- **RateMyProfessors Integration:**
  - {% include sfsymbol.html src="addition.svg" %} Added the ability to search RateMyProfessors on the Instructor page
  - This integration will show live data from the RateMyProfessors service.
  - This replaces a previous integration where professors were [searched ahead of time and embedded into the database](https://github.com/cougargrades/publicdata/tree/master/documents/com.ratemyprofessors).
  - **Disclaimer:**
    - _Similar to the SimpleSyllabus integration added in 1.1.3, this feature may break at any time if RMP decides to change how their website API works or blocks CougarGrades servers from accessing their service._
    - _As seen below, this feature may be less useful for instructors with long names or multiple surnames. This is because (for whatever reason) RateMyProfessors doesn't handle these well._

- {% include sfsymbol.html src="addition.svg" %} Added "Groups" back to the search box
  - This feature was removed in 1.1.0 because of some technical challenges with the new search system.
- {% include sfsymbol.html src="checkmark.svg" %} Fixed bug where a instructors were listed twice because their name was capitalized differently ([#128](https://github.com/cougargrades/web/issues/128))
  - This does *not* affect how an instructor many be listed multiple times due to small changes like their initials, middle name, etc.
- {% include sfsymbol.html src="checkmark.svg" %} Fixed bug where some Groups for a particular subject could have an identical name (ex: "Dance (Subject)" listed twice, once for "DAN" and "DANC")
