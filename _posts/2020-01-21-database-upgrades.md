**Fall 2019 data was received from the University of Houston and will begin processing on Wednesday, January 22, 2020.**

Upgrading the database requires a period of downtime where the database is wiped and recreated from scratch. This process usually takes about 10 hours. Accessing the site during this period could cause some unexpected or empty results when searching for courses or instructors. To prevent interruption during add/drop week, the upgrade will be started once course registration has closed.

As mentioned in the [0.4.1 update post]({% post_url 2020-01-15-update %}), this database upgrade will also implement a bug fix [where the instructor's departments field was incomplete and only represented one department](https://github.com/cougargrades/importer/commit/5c4995ebad68ca28f8c00a43a6faf3d7d69f75e5).
